# [Computer Vision Image Recognition Model]

## Project Description
For this project I used simple objects found in my backpack on a daily basis and incorporated them into a Teachable Machine Image Recogntion Model.
 
## Classes Identified
List of the objects or "classes" that were used to train the model to identify:
* Class 1: Pen
* Class 2: Glue Stick
* Class 3: Calculator
* Class 4: Hair Comb
* Class 5: Pencil

## Discussion & Reflection

1.  **Model Performance & Iteration:**
    * How accurate was your first trained model?
    * What steps did you take to iterate and improve its performance? (e.g., added more images, diversified image types for a specific class).
    * How did these changes affect the model's accuracy and confidence scores?

2.  **Challenges & Observations:**
    * Which objects were the easiest for your model to learn and distinguish? Why do you think that was?
    * Which objects were the most challenging? What made them difficult (e.g., similar shapes, variable appearances)?
    * What happened when you showed the model an object it wasn't trained on? How did the confidence scores behave, and why is this significant?

3.  **Bias in AI:**
    * If you only trained your "mug" class with images of *your specific mug* (and didn't vary color, shape, etc.), how well do you think it would recognize other students' significantly different mugs? How does this illustrate the concept of bias being introduced through training data?
    * Imagine all your training images were taken in very bright, direct lighting. What might happen if you tried to use the model in a dimly lit room or with strong shadows? How does this relate to the robustness and potential biases of AI models?

4.  **Model Limitations & Usefulness:**
    * What are some key limitations of the model you created?
    * Why is it useful to be able to download your trained model files (like `model.json`, `weights.bin`) and share them (e.g., via GitHub)? What does this enable?

5.  **Real-World Applications & Ethics:**
    * Brainstorm 2-3 real-world applications where a similar image classification model could be useful.
    * Briefly discuss one ethical consideration that developers should keep in mind when building and deploying image recognition AI in the real world (e.g., related to fairness, privacy, misuse).
